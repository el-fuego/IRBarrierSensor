# IR Barrier Sensor with LED always turned on

Barrier/distance IR sensor Arduino library  working with lightness changes

 - **Don`t sees difference between barriers and light * ([look below](#-barrier-differentiation-problem))**<br/>
 - Needs more power for LEDs<br/>
 - Small sensivity and can`t detect black objects * ([look below](#-sensivity-problem))<br/>
 + Can measure without any dalays<br/>

For higher sensivity and better barrier differentiation use <a href="https://github.com/el-fuego/IRBarrierSensorPulsedLED">IRBarrierSensorPulsedLED</a>

#### Circuit 
<img src="circuit.png" />

Vcc is +5V. <br/>
Use higher LED resitor impedance for higher voltage or lower for lower voltage

#### Algorithm
1. Calibrate sensor (store sensor value) on robot power ON and every n seconds (0.5 by defaults) if barrier is not detected
2. Calculate deviation between calibrated and current value
3. Barrier is detected when deviation is more than limit

#### * Barrier differentiation problem
For example, for me sensor value at 
* darkness = 1024
* evening with lights turned on = 1000
* rainy day at shadow = 50
* sunshine at shadow = 20
* sunshine (sensor is not turned to sun) = 2
* at evening wiht barrier at 20mm = 400
* at evening wiht barrier at 10mm = 200
* at evening wiht barrier at 3mm = 20

So, use **senfor screening** from daylights, if you want to use this algorithm

```

### * Sensivity problem
Use powerful or few LEDs
